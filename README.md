# IBO an Imaging Biomarker Ontology
The Imaging Biomarker Ontology describes radiological measurements that characterize biological processes (such as anisotropic water diffusion in a particular tissue region) of imaged subjects (such as neuro-imaging observations) and help clinicians, particularly in the assessment of therapeutic responses and the early prediction of pathologies. 

IBO is aligned to the [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/bfo.html) and  reuses several relevant biomedical ontologies:
* [Phenotype And Trait Ontology (PATO)](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/pato.html)
* [Information Artifact Ontology (IAO)](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/iao.html)
* [Gene Ontology (GO)](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/go.html)
* [Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (Chebi)](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/go.html)
* [Human Disease Ontology (DOID)](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/doid.html)
* 
To IBO ontology is available on IBO V1, please check the import of all the modules before reusing the ontology.
